# With Airbnb Eslint Example

This examples show how to add `eslint` and `airbnb` style to `after.js`.

`after.js` will display linting errors in the console when running `yarn start`.

## Note

This example doesn't work with the current version v0.5.2 of `after`, you should wait for the next release `after`
to try this example.
